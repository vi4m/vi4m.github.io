## A year with Anet A8 3D Printer

Today, you can buy 3dprinter just under 200$ (Anet A8 self assembly required in this case). This is price territory of generic “deskto printers”. Can you treat 3D printer as indispensable tool for everyday tasks ? Is 3d printer a gizmo you can ditch after 2 weeks of playing, or something you use every day? 
This is quick shortcut of my experiences with it. 

## How I used my Anet A8 printer in a 1 year

### Broken IKEA doors 

My IKEA dishwasher has been broken one day. Quick diagnostic showed broken door. One small plastic cap broke I half after many cycles of opening and closing. I decided to measure it, and print it out. It worked great for 2 weeks, than broke again. It showed that the problem was with construction - the arc was too small to bear with weight of doors. Having my part modeled was the best part of the game - I just changed one border to enlarge it and - voila. Printed 4 parts in advance at once.  Working great till today. 

### Dishwasher

My dishwasher door broke one day. The problem was with one small plastic part, which is quite often material used by IKEA furniture. I decided to give my 3D printer a try.  Tinkercad was chosen as the simplest app to quickly prototype part. I had no previous 3D-modeling experience whatsoever. 


It took some time to measure the part but it was really quick and easy to print it out. I took 3 tries to improve it further to make it slightly bolder than original to not broke anymore.
