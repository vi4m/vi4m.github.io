## A year with Anet A8 3D Printer

Today, you can buy 3dprinter just under 200$ (Anet A8 self assembly required in this case). This is price territory of generic “desktop printers”. I've used my 3D printer **more** often than desktop printer! After 1 year, I'm really happy with the purchase, and don't regret it. Some parts such as: filament heads, and bearings needed to be replaced, but it was easy to do, and the parts are ready available.

## How I used my Anet A8 printer in a 1 year

### Dishwasher

My IKEA dishwasher door broke one day. The problem was with one small plastic part, which is quite often material used by IKEA furniture. I decided to give my 3D printer a try.  Tinkercad was chosen as the simplest app to quickly prototype part. I had no previous 3D-modeling experience whatsoever.

It took some time to measure the part but it was really quick and easy to print it out. I took 3 tries to improve it further to make it slightly bolder than original to not broke anymore. 

## Lifehacks

Small life hacks here and there. Bathroom improvements.

### Boxes

I've used wood-based filament, quite expensive but worth it: https://3dreaktor.pl/filament-WOOD/Fiberlogy-FiberWood-750g-175

I had to increase printing head diameter to 0.5, to not constanly get stuck. 
But it made the difference in overall outlook of the product! Looks like real wood!
