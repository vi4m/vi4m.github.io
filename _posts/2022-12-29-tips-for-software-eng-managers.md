## Don't ask for permission; ask for forgiveness

* If it's a good idea, and it doesn't break anything - do it. It's faster to do it and learn from mistakes. 
* Systems are inflexible by design. But are the only way to drive the organization. If the system accepts it - do it. If the system is broken - ask me to change it. Not everything can be improved right away. Be patient.
* I forgive people trying to do things and making mistakes. I don't forgive avoiding things.

## Release early release often

* Shipping early without getting feedback is stupidity. But shipping early just for listening to the customer's feedback is the art of wisdom.
* Be bold and ship an unpolished version; you are fighting with the market. Don't criticize your colleges for shipping MVP.
* Always share your proposals early to get initial feedback, before you invest more energy into finishing it.

## Focus on things that give results

* Working Code beats the best ideas.
* Written proposal beats every meeting.
* Building prototypes beats thinking if it's worth doing it.

## Communication is not meetings

* Review your calendar every month.
* Avoid being at meetings only for "just in case" / "curiosity".
* Leave meetings where you don't contribute to.
* Discussions and processes are not the results; decisions and tools could be the results.

## Culture and Strategy

* The culture of people beats executive strategy every day. 
* If you want to know the culture of the company, listen to the jokes, it tells the truth under the surface.
* The only way to change the culture is to empower good parts of it.

## People are not resources

The best team is the effect of training, not recruitment.

* Don't assume you will just *get* the best developer from the market.  As a leader, your job is to develop and grow your team. Hire potential, and invest into people. 
* People will remember you for how you grew your team and what kind of teacher you have been. People love great teachers.
* Build a plan for the development of Junior, Mid, Senior, and Principal engineers. Most people don't build plans not to specify points of failure. 
* If you want to make everyone happy, don't become a leader. Good leaders make decisions that are good for the team in the long term, which can differ from individual goals.


## Communication

* Communication is such a crucial skill for the developer as the seven layers of the network stack are for microservices.
* If you are good at communication, you probably need to be corrected. Communication skills cover so many aspects of your job that it's a never-ending skill to develop.
* Invest in developing skills on how to do the best PR review, how to create good commit messages, take a course on how to write tech proposals, ADR, write concise documentation, make screencasts, and even the art of convincing management to  secure the budget.
* Most of the "the product were great, but management has killed it" problems might come from not understanding how to communicate its features, progress, and problems.
* Invest every year in building up your communication superpowers.
